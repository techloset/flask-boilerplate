Boilerplate for flask projects with best folder structure

# 1. Directory structure

Becaus Flask is a microframework it lets you decide on a lot of things. The structure of the Flask code is a personal view (or company view).

The directory structure that I recommend is:

### A typical top-level directory layout

    ├── application
    │ ├── __init__.py 
    ├── test                    # Test files (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
    │   ├── __init__.py
    ├── manage.py             
    └── requirements.txt
